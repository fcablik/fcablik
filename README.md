### Hey, I'm Filip.ðŸ‘‹ A very passionate Fullstack Web Developer.
I like to discover and learn new tech, frameworks & services. Continuous progress, learning and small steps ahead is what makes my job and life so awesome. I love to solve problems, in both logical and graphical ways.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on perfecting my Full Stack development skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently & still learning Remix.run, TypeScript & prisma w/ SQLite.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Remix.run projects.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'd very randomly started to learn coding before I even knew what it was and why it could make my life better. Started the 1st month of college, dropped after 2 more. Never looked back since. Life's been great as a Web Developer. ðŸ˜Š
