### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on perfecting my Full Stack development skills.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently & still learning Remix.run, TypeScript & prisma w/ SQLite.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Remix.run projects.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'd very randomly started to learn coding before I even knew what it was and why it could make my life better. Started the 1st month of college, dropped after 2 more. Never looked back since. Life's been great as a Web Developer. ğŸ˜Š
